# ============================================================
# CertVoice — Wrangler Configuration
#
# Deploys all Cloudflare Workers for CertVoice.
# Each worker is defined as a separate environment.
#
# IMPORTANT: Wrangler does NOT inherit top-level vars/bindings
# into environments. Each env must declare its own.
#
# Usage: Deployed via GitHub Action on push to main.
#        Each worker deploys independently.
#
# R2 Bucket: certvoice-storage (create in CF dashboard first)
#
# Secrets (set via CF dashboard → Workers → Settings → Variables):
#   DATABASE_URL, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY,
#   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET, UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL,
#   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN, CLERK_JWKS_URL
